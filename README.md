# Azure Quantum optimization samples

> Please note that Microsoft QIO solvers are deprecated and are no longer available in Azure Quantum post-June 30th 2023. Toshiba solvers in Azure Quantum are also deprecated as of February 6, 2024.

These samples demonstrate the use of quantum-inspired optimization (QIO) in the Azure Quantum service.

Each sample is self-contained in a folder, and demonstrates how to use the QIO solver in Azure Quantum to solve a problem.

## Prerequisites

To run these samples, there are some prerequisites:

1. [Create an Azure Quantum Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/how-to-create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-portal)
1. [Install Python on your system](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. [Install the `azure-quantum` Python module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/optimization-install-sdk)
1. (Optional) [Install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

## List of Available Samples

- **[Toshiba SQBM+](./samples/)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to submit a simple job with the Toshiba SQBM+ optimization solver in Azure Quantum.
