    "# Azure Quantum Optimization Sample: Secret Santa\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample walks through how to solve the Secret Santa problem using Azure Quantum. The scenario is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vincent, Tess, and Uma each write their name on a slip of paper and place the paper in a jar.\n",
    "- Everybody then draws a slip of paper from the jar at random.\n",
    "- Each person buys a small gift and writes a poem for the person whose name they have drawn.\n",
    "  - If they draw their own name, they return the slip of paper and re-draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**\n",
    "> The inspiration for this scenario came from Vincent's blog post ([found here](https://vincent.frl/quantum-secret-santa/)), which demonstrates how to use [Q# and the QDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/overview-what-is-qsharp-and-qdk) to solve this scenario. In this sample, we will make use of the [Azure Quantum QIO service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/optimization-what-is-quantum-optimization) to solve the same problem."
