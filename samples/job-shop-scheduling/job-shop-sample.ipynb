        "# Job Shop Scheduling Sample\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "Job shop scheduling is a common and important problem in many industries. For example, in the automobile industry manufacturing a car involves many different types of operations which are performed by a number of specialized machines - optimizing the production line to minimize manufacturing time can make for significant cost savings. \n",
        "\n",
        "The job shop scheduling problem is defined as follows: you have a set of jobs ($J_0, J_1, J_2, \\dots, J_{a-1} \\text{, where } a \\text{ is the total number of jobs}$), which have various processing times and need to be processed using a set of machines ($m_0, m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_{b-1}\\text{, where } b \\text{ is the total number of machines}$). The goal is to complete all jobs in the shortest time possible. This is called minimizing the **makespan**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each job consists of a set of operations, and the operations must be performed in the correct order to complete that job.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this sample, we'll introduce the necessary concepts and tools for describing this problem in terms of a penalty model, and then solve an example problem using the Azure Quantum Optimization service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine, for example, that you have a to-do list. Each item on the list is a **job** using this new terminology.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each job in this list consists of a set of operations, and each operation has a processing time. You also have some tools at hand that you can use to complete these jobs (the **machines**).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Each of the tasks (**operations**) in a todo (**job**) must take place in order. You can't print the receipt before you have made the payment! This is called a **precedence constraint**.\n",
        "2. You start an operation only once, and once started it must be completed before you do anything else. There's no time for procrastination! This is called the **operation-once constraint**.\n",
        "3. Each tool (**machine**) can only do one thing at a time. You can't simultaneously print two receipts unless you invest in multiple printers. This is the **no-overlap constraint**."

        "\n",

        "> If you have completed the Microsoft Quantum Learn Module [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/), this concept should already be familiar. A simplified version of this job shop sample is also available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-job-shop-optimization-azure-quantum/) on MS Learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each point on a cost function represents a different solution configuration - in this case, each configuration is a particular assignment of starting times for the operations you are looking to schedule. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the cost of the solution - in this instance the aim is to minimize the amount of time taken to complete all operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you can submit the problem to the Azure Quantum solvers, you'll need to transform it to a representation that the solvers can work with. This is done by creating an array of `Term` objects, representing the problem constraints. Positive terms penalize certain solution configurations, while negative ones support them. By adding penalties to terms that break the constraints, you increase the relative cost of those configurations and reduce the likelihood that the optimizer will settle for these suboptimal solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is to make these invalid solutions so expensive that the solver can easily locate valid, low-cost solutions by navigating to low points (minima) in the cost function. However, you must also ensure that these solutions are not so expensive as to create peaks in the cost function that are so high that the solver can't travel over them to discover better optima on the other side."

Remember however that your end goal is to obtain an *optimal* (or close to optimal) solution. In this case, you're looking for the schedule with the fastest completion time of all jobs.\n",

        "The makespan $M$ is defined as the total time required to run all jobs, or alternatively the finishing time of the last job, which is what you want to minimize.

Remember that the completion time of a job depends solely on the completion time of its final operation. However, since you have no way of knowing in advance what the last job will be, or at which time the last operation will finish, you'll need to include a term for each operation and time step. These terms need to scale with the time parameter $t$, and consider the operation processing time, in order to penalize large makespans over smaller ones.\n",

Recall that you are given a set of operations $\\{O_i\\}$, which each take processing time $p_i$ to complete. An operation scheduled at time $t$ will then *complete* at time $t + p_i$. Let's define the coefficient $w_t$ as the penalty applied to the cost function for an operation to finish at time $t$. As operations can be scheduled in parallel, you don't know how many might complete at any given time, but you do know that this number is at most equal to the number of available machines $m$. The sum of all penalty values for operations completed at time $t$ are thus in the range $[0, ~m \\cdot w_t]$. You want to avoid situations were completing a single operation at time $t+1$ is less expensive than m operations at time $t$. Thus, the penalty values cannot follow a simple linear function of time.\n",

In general, there's no absolute rule to determine the optimal value for each weight, and you might have to use some trial and error to figure out what works best for your problem. However, the guidelines below can help you get good starting point.\n",

        "Intuitively, it should be clear that satisfying the constraints is more important than minimizing the makespan. An invalid solution, even with a very small makespan, would be useless to you. The weights of the cost function can be used to reflect this fact. As a rule of thumb, breaking a single constraint should be around 5-10x more expensive than any valid solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start with an upper bound on the value of the cost function for any valid solution. At worst, a valid solution (meaning that $f(x) = g(x) = h(x) = 0$) contributes at most $m \\cdot w_{T-1+max(p_i)}$ to the cost function. This is the case when $m$ operations, all taking $max(p_i)$ to complete, are scheduled at the last time step $T-1$. For convenience, let's say that this should result in a cost function value of $1$. You can compute what the value of $\\delta$ should be to achieve this value. The code example you've been working with uses the following parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ m = 3, ~ T = 21, ~ max(p_i) = 3, ~ M_{lb} = 8, ~ w_t = \\frac{m^{t-M_{lb}}}{m-1} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "First, calculate the latest time an operation could finish. This is given by the max time $T$ (minus one because you are using 0-based indexing), plus the longest processing time for any operation ($max(p_i)$):\n",
        "$$t_{max} = T - 1 + max(p_i) = 21 - 1 + 3 = 23$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, calculate $w_{t_{max}}$:\n",
        "$$ w_{t_{max}} = \\frac{m ^ {t_{max} - M_{lb}}}{m - 1} = \\frac{3^{23 - 8}}{3 - 1} = \\frac{3^{15}}{2} = 7,174,453.5 $$\n",

        "As mentioned in the previous section, breaking a single constraint should incur a penalty roughly 5-10x higher than that of the worst valid solution. Assuming that breaking one constraint adds a value of $1$ to the cost function, you can set the remaining weights to:\n",

        "If instead one constraint is consistently broken, you probably need to increase its weight compared to the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Further adjustments\n",
        "\n",
        "You may also come across situations in which constraints are being broken without a particular preference for which. In this case, make sure the time $T$ given a large enough value. If $T$ is too small, there may not even exist a valid solution, or the solver could be too constrained to feasibly find one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optionally, if you're looking for better solutions than the ones obtained so far, you may always try to lower the value of $T$, or increase the importance of the makespan component $\\delta$. A tighter bound on the makespan can help the solver find a more optimal solution, as can increasing the weight $\\delta$. You may also find that doing so increases the speed at which a solution is found. If any problems pop up with broken constraints, you went too far and need to change the parameters in the other direction again."
