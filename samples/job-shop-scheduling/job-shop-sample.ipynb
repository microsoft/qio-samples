    "# Job Shop Scheduling Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Job shop scheduling is a common and important problem in many industries. For example, in the automobile industry manufacturing a car involves many different types of operations which are performed by a number of specialized machines - optimizing the production line to minimize manufacturing time can make for significant cost savings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The job shop scheduling problem is defined as follows: you have a set of jobs ($J_0, J_1, J_2, \\dots, J_{a-1} \\text{, where } a \\text{ is the total number of jobs}$), which have various processing times and need to be processed using a set of machines ($m_0, m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_{b-1}\\text{, where } b \\text{ is the total number of machines}$). The goal is to complete all jobs in the shortest time possible. This is called minimizing the **makespan**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each job consists of a set of operations, and the operations must be performed in the correct order to complete that job.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, we'll introduce the necessary concepts and tools for describing this problem in terms of a penalty model, and then solve an example problem using the Azure Quantum Optimization service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that you have a to-do list. Each item on the list is a **job** using this new terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each job in this list consists of a set of operations, and each operation has a processing time. You also have some tools at hand that you can use to complete these jobs (the **machines**).\n",
    "\n",
    "TODOs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pay electricity bill\n",
    "  1. Log in to site (*2 minutes*) - **computer**\n",
    "  2. Pay bill (*1 minute*) - **computer**\n",
    "  3. Print receipt (*3 minutes*) - **printer**\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Plan camping trip\n",
    "  1. Pick campsite (*2 minutes*) - **computer**\n",
    "  2. Pay online (*2 minutes*) - **computer**\n",
    "  3. Print receipt (*3 minutes*) - **printer**\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Book dentist appointment\n",
    "  1. Choose time (*1 minute*) - **computer**\n",
    "  2. Pay online (*2 minutes*) - **computer**\n",
    "  3. Print receipt (*3 minutes*) - **printer**\n",
    "  4. Guiltily floss your teeth (*2 minutes*)  - **tooth floss**\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are some constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each of the tasks (**operations**) in a todo (**job**) must take place in order. You can't print the receipt before you have made the payment! This is called a **precedence constraint**.\n",
    "2. You start an operation only once, and once started it must be completed. There's no time for procrastination! This is called the **operation-once constraint**.\n",
    "3. Each tool (**machine**) can only do one thing at a time. You can't simultaneously print two receipts unless you invest in multiple printers. This is the **no-overlap constraint**."

    "## Cost functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this sample will be spent constructing what is known as a **cost function**, which is used to represent the problem. This cost function is what will be submitted to the Azure Quantum Optimization solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: \n",
    "> If you have completed Microsoft Quantum Learn Module 9, [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/), this concept should already be familiar. A simplified version of this sample is also available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-job-shop-scheduling-optimization-problem) on MS Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point on a cost function represents a different solution configuration - in this case, each configuration is a particular assignment of starting times for the operations you are looking to schedule. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the cost of the solution - in this instance the aim is to minimize the amount of time taken to complete all operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can submit the problem to the Azure Quantum solvers, you'll need to transform it to a representation that the solvers can work with. This is done by creating an array of `Term` objects, representing the problem constraints. Positive terms penalize certain solution configurations, while negative ones support them. By adding penalties to terms that break the constraints, you increase the relative cost of those configurations and reduce the likelihood that the optimizer will settle for these suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to make these invalid solutions so expensive that the solver can easily locate valid, low-cost solutions by navigating to low points (minima) in the cost function. However, you must also ensure that these solutions are not so expensive as to create peaks in the cost function that are so high that the solver can't travel over them to discover better optima on the other side."

    "Above, you can see that the jobs have been labeled as $J$ and assigned index numbers $0$, $1$ and $2$, to represent each of the three tasks you have. The operations that make up each job have also been defined, and are represented by the letter $O$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to code up later, all operations are identified with a continuous index number rather than, for example, starting from $0$ for each job. This allows you to keep track of operations by their ID numbers in the code and schedule them according to the constraints and machine availability. You can tie the operations back to their jobs later on using a reference.\n",

    "## Expressing a cost function using the Azure Quantum Optimization SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see during the exploration of the cost function and its constituent penalty terms below, the overall cost function is quadratic (because the highest order polynomial term you have is squared). This makes this problem a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problem, which is a specific subset of **Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO)** problems (which allow for higher-order polynomial terms than quadratic). Fortunately, the Azure Quantum Optimization service is set up to accept PUBO (and Ising) problems, which means you don't need to modify the above representation to fit the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "As introduced above, the binary variables over which you are optimizing are the operation starting times $x_{i,t}$. Instead of using two separate indices as in the mathematical formulation, you will need to define a singly-indexed binary variable $x_{i \\cdot T + t}$. Given time steps $t \\in [0, T-1]$, every operation $i$ contributes $T$ indices. The operation starts at the value of $t$ for which $x_{i \\cdot T + t}$ equals 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to submit a problem to the Azure Quantum services, you will first be creating a `Problem` instance. This is a Python object that stores all the required information, such as the cost function details and what kind of problem we are modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent cost functions, we'll make use of a formulation using `Term` objects. Ultimately, any polynomial cost function can be written as a simple sum of products. That is, the function can be rewritten to have the following form, where $p_k$ indicates a product over the problem variables $x_0, x_1, \\dots$:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this form, every term in the sum has a coefficient $\\alpha_k$ and a product $p_k$. In the `Problem` instance, each term in the sum is represented by a `Term` object, with parameters `c` - corresponding to the coefficient, and `indices` - corresponding to the product. Specifically, the `indices` parameter is populated with the indices of all variables appearing in the term. For instance, the term $2 \\cdot (x_1 \\cdot x_2)$ translates to the following object: `Term(c=2, indices=[1,2])`.\n",

    "More generally, `Term` objects take on the following form:\n",

    "\n",
    "As seen previously, you want to assign a penalty whenever the sum of $x_{i,t}$ values across all possible $t$ values is not equal to 1. This is how you represent that mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x) = \\sum_{i} \\left(\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1\\right)^2.$$\n",

    "Let's break that down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "  As you saw in the sum row of the tables in the worked example, $\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}$ should always equal exactly 1 (meaning that an operation must be scheduled **once and only once** during the allowed time). This means that $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1$ should always give 0. This means there is no penalty assigned when the constraint is not violated.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In the case where $\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t} > 1$ (meaning an operation is scheduled to start more than once, like in the second example above), you now have a positive, non-zero penalty term as $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1 > 0$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In the case where $\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t} = 0$ (meaning an operation is never scheduled to start, like in the last example above), you now have a $-1$ penalty term as $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\left(\\sum\\dots\\right)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Because the penalty terms must always be positive (otherwise you would be *reducing* the penalty when an operation isn't scheduled), you must square the result of $\\left(\\sum_{0\\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\\right) - 1$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This ensures that the penalty term is always positive (as $(-1)^2 = 1$).\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i} \\left((\\dots)^2\\right)$\n",

    "## Minimize the makespan\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've learned how to represent constraints of your optimization problem with a penalty model, which allows you to obtain *valid* solutions to your problem from the optimizer. Remember however that your end goal is to obtain an *optimal* (or close to optimal) solution. In this case, you're looking for the schedule with the fastest completion time of all jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The makespan $M$ is defined as the total time required to run all jobs, or alternatively the finishing time of the last job, which is what you want to minimize. To this end, you need to add a fourth component to the cost function that adds larger penalties for solutions with larger makespans:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(x) = \\alpha \\cdot f(x) + \\beta \\cdot g(x) + \\gamma \\cdot h(x) + \\mathbf{\\delta \\cdot k(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's come up with terms that increase the value of the cost function the further out the last job is completed. Remember that the completion time of a job depends solely on the completion time of its final operation. However, since you have no way of knowing in advance what the last job will be, or at which time the last operation will finish, you'll need to include a term for each operation and time step. These terms need to scale with the time parameter $t$, and consider the operation processing time, in order to penalize large makespans over smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some care is required in determining the penalty values, or *coefficients*, of these terms. Recall that you are given a set of operations $\\{O_i\\}$, which each take processing time $p_i$ to complete. An operation scheduled at time $t$ will then *complete* at time $t + p_i$. Let's define the coefficient $w_t$ as the penalty applied to the cost function for an operation to finish at time $t$. As operations can be scheduled in parallel, you don't know how many might complete at any given time, but you do know that this number is at most equal to the number of available machines $m$. The sum of all penalty values for operations completed at time $t$ are thus in the range $[0, ~m \\cdot w_t]$. You want to avoid situations were completing a single operation at time $t+1$ is less expensive than m operations at time $t$. Thus, the penalty values cannot follow a simple linear function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precisely, you want your coefficients to satisfy:\n",
    "$$ w_{t+1} > m \\cdot w_{t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a suitable parameter $\\epsilon > 0$, you can then solve the following recurrence relation:\n",
    "$$ w_{t+1} = m \\cdot w_{t}+\\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution is given by the function:\n",
    "$$ w_{t} = \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{m^t-1}{m-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limiting the number of terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! You now have a formula for the coefficients of the makespan penalty terms that increase with time while taking into account that operations can be scheduled in parallel. Before implementing the new terms, let's try to limit the amount of new terms you're adding as much as possible. To illustrate, recall the job shop example you've been working on:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "J_{0} &= \\{O_{0}, O_{1}, O_{2}\\} \\\\\n",
    "J_{1} &= \\{O_{3}, O_{4}, O_{5}\\} \\\\\n",
    "J_{2} &= \\{O_{6}, O_{7}, O_{8}, O_{9}\\} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider that you only need the last operation in every job, as the precedence constraint guarantees that all other operations are completed before it. Given $n$ jobs, you thus consider only the operations $\\{O_{k_0-1}, O_{k_1-1}, \\dots, O_{k_{n-1}-1}\\}$, where the indices $k_j$ denotes the number of operations up to and including job $j$. In this example, you only add terms for the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\{O_2, O_5, O_9\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{with } k_0 = 3, k_1 = 6, k_2 = 10 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can find a lower bound for the makespan and only penalize makespans that are greater than this minimum. A simple lower bound is given by the longest job, as each operation within a job must execute sequentially. You can express this lower bound as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M_{lb} = \\max\\limits_{0 \\leq j \\lt n} \\{ \\sum_{i = k_j}^{k_{j+1}-1} p_i \\} \\leq M $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the processing times given in this example, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "J_{0} &: ~~ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 \\\\\n",
    "J_{1} &: ~~ p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 \\\\\n",
    "J_{2} &: ~~ p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8 \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "&\\Rightarrow M_{lb} = 8\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the makespan is upper-bounded by the sequential execution time of all jobs, 6 + 7 + 8 = 21 in this case. The simulation time T should never exceed this upper bound. Regardless of whether this is the case or not, you need to include penalties for all time steps up to T, or else larger time steps without a penalty will be favored over smaller ones!\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makespan penalty terms are only added for the last operation in every job $\\{O_{k_0-1}, O_{k_1-1}, \\dots, O_{k_{n-1}-1}\\}$\n",
    "- The makespan is lower-bounded by the longest job $\\Rightarrow$ only include terms for time steps $M_{lb} < t < T$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing the penalty terms\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to add the makespan terms to the cost function. Recall that all terms contain a coefficient and one (or multiple) binary decision variables $x_{i,t}$. Contrary to the coefficients $w_t$ defined above, where $t$ refers to the completion time of an operation, the variables $x_{i,t}$ determine if an operation $i$ is *scheduled* at time t. To account for this difference, you'll have to shift the variable index by the operation's processing time $p_i$. All makespan terms can then be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k(x) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{k_0-1, \\dots, k_{n-1}-1\\}} \\left( \\sum_{M_{lb} < t < T+p_i} w_t \\cdot x_{i, ~t-p_i} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you need to make a small modification to the coefficient function so that the first value $w_{M_{lb}+1}$ always equals one. With $\\epsilon = 1$ and $t_0 = M_{lb}$ you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_{t} = \\frac{m^{t-t_0}-1}{m-1} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Great! You've learned how to model a cost function, run a solver, and verify the solution of an optimization problem using Azure Quantum. Using your knowledge, you successfully repaired your ship! However, you may have been wondering how exactly the weights that appear in the cost function were chosen. Let's take a look at a general method that can help you balance the different components that make up a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall, the cost function is made up of four components, one for each constraint and one to minimize the makespan:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(x) = \\alpha \\cdot f(x) + \\beta \\cdot g(x) + \\gamma \\cdot h(x) + \\delta \\cdot k(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance attributed to each term can be adjusted using the weights (coefficients) $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\text{ and } \\delta$. The process of adjusting these weights is referred to as *parameter tuning*. In general, there's no absolute rule to determine the optimal value for each weight, and you might have to use some trial and error to figure out what works best for your problem. However, the guidelines below can help you get good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusting the optimization term weight\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, it should be clear that satisfying the constraints is more important than minimizing the makespan. An invalid solution, even with a very small makespan, would be useless to you. The weights of the cost function can be used to reflect this fact. As a rule of thumb, breaking a single constraint should be around 5-10x more expensive than any valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an upper bound on the value of the cost function for any valid solution. At worst, a valid solution (meaning that $f(x) = g(x) = h(x) = 0$) contributes at most $m \\cdot w_{T-1+max(p_i)}$ to the cost function. This is the case when $m$ operations, all taking $max(p_i)$ to complete, are scheduled at the last time step $T-1$. For convenience, let's say that this should result in a cost function value of $1$. You can compute what the value of $\\delta$ should be to achieve this value. The code example you've been working with uses the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m = 3, ~ T = 21, ~ max(p_i) = 3, ~ M_{lb} = 8, ~ w_t = \\frac{m^{t-M_{lb}}}{m-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, calculate the latest time an operation could finish. This is given by the max time $T$ (minus one because you are using 0-based indexing), plus the longest processing time for any operation ($max(p_i)$):\n",
    "$$t_{max} = T - 1 + max(p_i) = 21 - 1 + 3 = 23$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, calculate $w_{t_{max}}$:\n",
    "$$ w_{t_{max}} = \\frac{m ^ {t_{max} - M_{lb}}}{m - 1} = \\frac{3^{23 - 8}}{3 - 1} = \\frac{3^{15}}{2} = 7,174,453.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper bound is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m \\cdot w_{t_{max}} = 3 \\times 7,174,453.5 = 21,523,360.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the desired value of $1$, you can approximately set the weight to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta = \\frac{1}{m \\cdot w_{t_{max}}} = \\frac{1}{21,523,360.5} = 0.00000005 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusting the constraint weights\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, breaking a single constraint should incur a penalty roughly 5-10x higher than that of the worst valid solution. Assuming that breaking one constraint adds a value of $1$ to the cost function, you can set the remaining weights to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can run a problem instance and use the verifier to check if any constraints are being broken. If all constraints are satisfied, congratulations! You should have obtained a good solution from the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead one constraint is consistently broken, you probably need to increase its weight compared to the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also come across situations in which constraints are being broken without a particular preference for which. In this case, make sure the time $T$ given a large enough value. If $T$ is too small, there may not even exist a valid solution, or the solver could be too constrained to feasibly find one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, if you're looking for better solutions than the ones obtained so far, you may always try to lower the value of $T$, or increase the importance of the makespan component $\\delta$. A tighter bound on the makespan can help the solver find a more optimal solution, as can increasing the weight $\\delta$. You may also find that doing so increases the speed at which a solution is found. If any problems pop up with broken constraints, you went too far and need to change the parameters in the other direction again."
