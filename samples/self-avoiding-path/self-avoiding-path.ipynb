    "# Self Avoiding Path with Azure Quantum Inspired Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll cover how to formulate an optimization problem to find a path through a 3D lattice that does not cross itself (self-avoiding walk/path). The optimization problem is solved with the Azure Quantum service which contains numerous heuristic (non-linear) optimization solvers. Finding a self-avoiding path in a 3D lattice can be considered a difficult problem, in the sense that it has suffers from exponential scaling conditioned on the number of turns and the number of dimensions (2D vs 3D, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a step by step approach is taken to explain the function definitions to are necessary to create the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: To find a path in a 3D lattice that does not cross itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify some vocab and assumptions used in the notebook:\n",
    "1. The number of dimensions is 3 (3D), meaning the path can be represented in a $x$-$y$-$z$ plane.\n",
    "2. The position represents the location in the x-y-z plane, thus given by ($x$,$y$,$z$).\n",
    "3. A direction describes the orientation of within in the x-y-z plane, thus in {$+x$,$-x$,$+y$,$-y$,$+z$,$-z$}.\n",
    "4. \"Turns\" are equivalent to \"steps\". After each turn a new position is acquired that must be unique (not visited before). \n",
    "5. The total number of turns is equivalent to the number of positions that needs to be visited minus one ($N-1$). \n",
    "6. The decision variables for the optimization function are denoted by \"q\" because \"x\" is already associated with a direction, and are referred to as \"optimization variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Because the number of terms to for this optimization problem grows explosively with the number of turns, you might want to try running this in the Azure Quantum notebooks. The more technical reason for this is that expansions of nonlinear terms have to be computed locally resulting in massive number of terms needing to be uploaded. Unless you are very patient, a recommendation would be to either check out the online notebook experience or rewrite this notebook's problem class to its streaming counterpart (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/optimization-streaming-problem). \n"

    "# Part 2. Finding the difference in positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Great that we have the directions defined! Now let's use them and define a function that calculates the difference in positions, which we will need later. After each turn, a direction that appends to the path. A valid path is defined as a one that does not cross itself, meaning that we need to compare the positions over the turns. In other words, every new position appended to the path needs to be checked with all previously held positions, to verify that a position hasn't been visited twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we go about this?\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a way to know the positions after choosing to go in a certain direction, so let's tackle that first. Consider the fact that the directions are recorded for each turn, which already gives some sort of log of the positions in the path. By summing the direction variables respective to their dimension (x/y/z) acoomplishes this, but only if a negative move can compensate a positive one. For example, after two turns the $x$-location can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_2 =  ( d^{1}_{+x} - d^{1}_{-x} ) + ( d^{2}_{+x} - d^{2}_{-x} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** In the above function (\"direction_variables\"), the negative sign for the negative direction variables is controlled through \"sign_dir\". \"sign_dir\" must be set to -1 to assign a negative sign to it as required in these position formulas!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that for a turn only one direction variable can be set to 1! Thus if two moves in the $-x$ direction are taken, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_2 =  ( d^{1}_{+x} - d^{1}_{-x} ) + ( d^{2}_{+x} - d^{2}_{-x} ) =  ( 0 - 1 ) + ( 0 - 1 ) = -2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the simple example for the x-dimension, the same can be applied to the $x$ and $y$ directions. The formulas below descrive the position after some number of turns through a summation (for the maths/physics enthousiasts, these are integrals of the velocities to derive the positions :) ).\n",

    "$$ x^k = \\sum_{k=1}^{k} ( d^{k}_{+x} - d^{k}_{-x} ) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Great stuff! Now we have a method to find the positions along the path. To find the differences in position, for example between turn 2 and turn 1, it is only necessary to apply a subtraction: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_2 - x_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} ( d^{k}_{+x} - d^{k}_{-x} ) - \\sum_{k=1}^{1} ( d^{k}_{+x} - d^{k}_{-x}) = ( d^{2}_{+x} - d^{2}_{-x} ) $$\n",

Consider the constraint in its simplest form:\n",

    "\n",
    "The distance constraint enforces a minimum distance of 1 between the different taken positions. However, for two consecutive turns, it does not completely prevent (to a high enough degree) going to a previous position. A simplified explanation for this is that the distance constraint is described through the positional differences in $x$, $y$, and $z$. Additionally, for consecutive turns, the number of slack variables is zero ($(i-j)^2-1 = 0$ for consecutive turns} - thus there is no auxiliary benefit introduced by slack variables to compensate for being in a different position after the turn. Therefore, the solver will try to keep the positions as close to each other as possible, which leads to overlapping positions, especially in consecutive turns. To overcome this, a penalization needs to be introduced that stops returning to the previous position held in the turn before. For example, what we want to stop is the following:\n",

    "$$ \\text{Turn 1: A to B.} $$\n",
    "$$ \\text{Turn 2: B to A.} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Designing such a constraint is straightforward, the opposite direction variables need to be multiplied. \n",

To prevent the solver from generating these invalid directions we'll need to add two constraints.

If we were to design the constraints as $ q_{0+\\gamma} q_{1+\\gamma} q_{2+\\gamma} $ there won't be any penalty, because all $q$'s will equal and multiply to zero.

    "First it is necessary to build the entire optimization problem, comprising of the constraint functions. The optimization problem is then sent to a specified Azure QIO solver, such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering (heuristic solvers), which try to find a good solution to the problem. The the nonlinear optimization constraint weights and the solvers need tuning to find a valid path, which is a difficult process. To see a valid path, you can first run the with the provided parameters, as the solver and the cost function have been tuned to find these values. Other than that, feel free to play around with the values. Note that it is easier to tune for smaller problem sizes (nodes/positions) since the simulation times are smaller, however, the parameters do not map well to larger problems. Additionally, a suggestion is to first use the parameter-free solvers to limit the tuning work to the constraint weights. \n",
