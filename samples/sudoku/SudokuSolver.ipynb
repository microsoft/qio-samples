    "# Solving sudokus with Azure Quantum Optimization solvers\n",

    "Hello! In this Jupyter notebook we will explain and solve Sudoku puzzles with Azure quantum-inspired optimization solvers. This automation step will allow you check your sudoku solutions, or even better, you'll never have to do a soduku manually again! For humans these puzzles can be very challenging and time-consuming, even though the rules of the game are quite simple. An easy use-case to learn more about optimization in an applied way!\n",

    "### Side Note: \n",
    "Here you will learn about how to convert a mixed integer linear programming problem (\"MILP\") into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimiation (\"PUBO\") problem. The Azure quantum inspired solvers, or even the specific underlying hardware, **might not be the most suitable for solving** Sudoku problems. Nevertheless, these small scale problems are good learning material for more challenging optimization problems you may face elsewhere. Additionally for very large the sudokus, or optimization solvers in general, heuristic approaches become increasingly attractive in respect to other methods. \n"

    "\n",
    "- Sudoku is an NP-complete problem ($\\text{iff}$ grid size is considered variable $n^2 \\times n^2$). In short, this means that finding a solution is difficult (nondeterministic-polynomial time), but verifying the solution can be done easily (polynomial time) and that the problem is reducible to other NP problem variations in polynomial time. \n",
    "- Because of the NP-completeness, it is hard to say what kind of solver works 'best'. However, as always, certain algorithms are (or can be) more suitable for a problem. \n",
    "    - For a small Sudokus, like $9\\times9$, backtracking techniques are useful (like Algorithm X with \"Dancing Links\"). Backtracking algorithms test out all (partial) solutions to find the one that satisfies the constraints. \n",
    "    - For large Sudokus, like $81\\times81$, backtracking techniques become computationally expensive. Other methods, such as constraint relaxation to employ linear programming (could also use branch-and-bound) or stochastic optimization (QIO) can then also be considered. These methods have their own specific advantages and disadvantages. In fact, these methods are not even guaranteed to converge to due to the inherent approximations, local minima, non-determinism, etc. \n",
    "    - Sudoku puzzles can be considered a graph-coloring problem, each integer-value would be associated with a color. The graph-coloring problem a famous and difficult one, read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring. If you're interested in solving the graph coloring problem with Q#, check out this module: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/.   \n",

    "### Problem background\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku puzzles usually take place on a $9\\times9$ grid, but can be any $n^2 \\times n^2$ grid, in which many numbers are missing. The goal is to fill in numbers $x_i \\in \\{1,2,...,n^2\\}$ such that the following constraints are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraint 1: A number may appear only once per row. \n",
    "- Constraint 2: A number may appear only once per column.\n",
    "- Constraint 3: A number may appear only once per $n\\times n$ subgrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! Finding the solution however, which you may assume is unique (depends on the number of blanks), is not straightforward. Solving these puzzles, which belong to a class called \"constraint satisfaction problems\",  is a lengthy iterative procedure. Fortunately, computers can speed things up a bit! Numerous algorithmic approaches exist, such as backtracking, mixed integer linear programming, simplex method with constraint relaxations, stochastic optimization, or brute force searches. The links in the 'interesting notes' section will refer you to further reading!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will consider converting the mixed integer linear programming problem (\"MILP\"/\"ILP\") to a binary integer linear programming problem, which will then be cast as a polynomial unconstrained optimization problem (\"PUBO\"). The difference between these is how the optimization problems are expressed. In MILP, the optimization variables can take any integer value in the set $x_i \\in \\{1,2,...,n^2\\}$. In the binary case, the optimization variables can only take values of 0 and 1, $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Lastly, for the Azure quantum-inspired solvers to understand the problem, it is necessary to convert the problem to a PUBO (or Ising for other problems) model. \n",

    "## Converting to a binary optimization problem - variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Azure solvers it is necessary to recast the sudoku optimization problem to a binary form. There are two available formats, the Ising model $x_i \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ and the PUBO/QUBO model $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Here we will consider the the second, which is the easiest way to rewrite the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going from $x_i \\in \\{1,2,...n^2\\}$ to $x_i \\in {0,1}$ requires a different formulation for the problem. Consider a single cell in which we want to assign a particular value. Now it is not possible to simply assign a number in the set. However what we can do is abstract a little bit. Representing each value in the set $\\{1,2,...n^2\\}$ by a binary variable $x_v$ is neat trick to convert to a binary problem. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{The value 1 can be represented by } x_{{1}}$$\n",
    "$$ \\text{The value 2 can be represented by } x_{{2}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Now if a value 2 needs to be filled into a cell, we can describe that by assigning $x_2=1$, and keeping all other variables equal to zero. Why do other variables need to be zero? The reason is that we are **selecting per cell**, and only one value may be filled in a cell. Therefore there are $n^2$ variables per cell in order to describe which integer needs to be filled in. \n",
    "\n",
    "To eloborate on the cell values, the row and column number needs to be given to distinguish integers assigned to different cells. For simplicity, we can assume an indexing of $x_{{r,c,v}}$, with $r$ denoting the row number, $c$ the column number, and $v$ representing the value in the set integer set. For example, if we want to assign cell (8,8) a value in the shown picture above, which is the most bottom right cell (cell count starts at 0), then we'd have to choose from the set of variables:\n",

    "## One value per cell constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the reformulation, there are $n^2$ variables per cell. Only one of these variables may be assigned a value 1 by the solver, as the rules of Sudoku prohibit filling in multiple integers per cell. For this, another constraint has to be added to the problem to avoid multiple variables per cell becoming nonzero. It is necessary to penalize relationships between variables that reside in the same cells. One easy way to accomplish this is to penalize the products of variables. Considering a single cell, you could model the constraint as: \n",

Investigating the constraint more thoroughly, you may realize that the constituent parts must also be zero. The constraint of the $n^2$ variables can be split. Only one variable may be assigned a value 1 by the solver, essentially meaning that we have to check each dual combination between variables. If all are zero, then you can be sure that **no more** than one variable has value 1. Mathematically the idea is expressed as:\n",

Because each integer in a row must  be unique, we will be weighting combinations of variables that represent the same integer. This will force each row to consist of only unique integers, and hence will automatically ensure that the summation of the cells equal the sum of unique integers. Consider a general $9 \\times 9$ sudoku, $x_3$ and $x_{12}$ both represent the integer '4' (first row, first and second cell), the solver may not set both equal to 1. To avoid that from happening it is necessary to penalize this relation, as is done by:\n",

However we don't need to weight combinations between variables on the same rows and columns, as that was already done in the previous constraints. \n",

    "As we've constructed a dictionary of lists of all subgrid variables, it has become much easier to start making combinations.

    "But now the big question remains, how do we weight the combinations of variables that are not on the same row or column? Those are the only combinations that need to be assigned weights, right?\n",

    "Correct, so what we do is calculate the row and column for each variable (row and column for the entire Sudoku). This is to make sure the integers are not horizontally or vertically aligned, because this has already been considered in previous constraints.
