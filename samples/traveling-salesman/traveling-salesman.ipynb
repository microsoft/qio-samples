    "## Introduction\n",
    "The traveling salesman problem is a well-known optimization problem in which the (near) optimal route through a network of nodes wants to be found. As you will see later on, it is not a straightforward problem to solve as the complexity (difficulty) grows exponentially with the number of nodes. Additionally, due to the rugged (non-convex) optimization space, it is difficult or even impossible to find an optimal route (global minimum/optimal solution) through a large network. Common solvers for these rugged problems are based on searches, which you will implement in this tutorial with Azure QIO!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have to calculate an optimal route for the salesman over a number of N nodes (addresses). Your manager wants you to minimize the traveling cost (time/distance/money/etc.) such that the salesman is more profitable. There are a number of constraints which have to be satisfied by the salesman:\n",
    "1. The salesman is required to visit each node. \n",

Here, i denotes the origin node and j denotes the destination node. To keep matters simple for now, both i and j can be any node in the set of N nodes. \n",

This can be done by multiplying the cost matrix with a vector from the left, and a vector from the right! The left vector will specify the origin node and the right vector the destination node.

For the salesman to be in a single location, after or before a trip, requires that only one element in the origin or destination vector is equal to 1, with the rest being 0.

Instead of using a sum to express this, an equally valid way would be to use products.

    "### Constraint 2: The salesman must be somewhere, he can't dissapear\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the first constraint, the salesman is penalized for being in multiple nodes at once. But due do the formulation of this constraint it is possible that the solver puts all all $x_k$ in a location vector equal to zero, meaning that the salesman could be 'nowhere' after some trip (By looking at the code and previous sections up until this section you come to the conclusion that the minimal cost is obtained by setting all $x_k$ to 0). To encourage the salesman to not dissapear, it is necessary to reward him for being somewhere. Rewards can be assigned by incorporating negatively weighted terms to the cost function that decrease (remember minimization) the cost function value for valid solutions of the optimization problem. To demonstrate this point, take the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{f(x)} := \\underset{x_0, x_1, x_2}{min} x_0 + x_1 - x_2.$$ \n",
    "$$ \\text{with } x_0, x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum value for the example is attained for the solution $x_0$ = 0, $x_1$ = 0, $x_2$ = 1, with the optimal function value equal to -1. Here, the negatively weighted third term encourages $x_2$ to take a value 1 rather than 0, unlike $x_0$ and $x_1$. With this idea in mind, you can stop the salesman from dissapearing. If the salesman has to visit $N+1$ nodes over a route then $N+1$ of the $x_k$ variables must be assigned the value 1. Written as an equation, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{N(N+1)-1} x_k = N+1,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $(N(N+1))$ equal to the number of variables to represent the nodes before/after each trip. You could split the equation for each location vector seperately, but if you keep the constraint linear in $x_k$ the resulting cost function will be the same. To assign a reward to the salesman for being in a node the $x_k$ terms are moved to the right side of the equation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0 = (N+1) -\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N(N+1)-1} x_k \\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may be aware, there is no guarantee which $x_k$ the solver will want to assign the value 1 in this equation. However, in the previous constraint the salesman is already enforced to be in a maximum of one node before/after some trip. Therefore with the cost function weights properly tuned, it can be assumed that the salesman will not be in two or more nodes at once. In other words, the previous constraint penalizes the salesman for being in more than 1 node at a once, while this constraint rewards him for being in as many nodes before/after any trip (also being in multiple nodes at once). The weights of the constraints will effectively determine how well they are satisfied, a balance between the two needs to be found such that both are adhered to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating this constraint in the code can be done by assigning a negative term to each $x_k$. The $N+1$ value can be ignored, since it results in a linear shift of the optimization landscape and does not have an effect on solutions of the the minimization problem.\n",

    "For example, if you want the salesman to start/end in a particular node you can assign negative weights to the respective $x_k$ term in the first and last location vector. For node 0 that would result in negatively weighting $x_0$ and $x_{N^2}$, for example. This constraint is the most flexible one, and you can also expand it to encourage the salesman to visit a specific node, or nodes, at pre-determined trip number $k$. Alternatively, you may see this constraint as a  way to integrate prior-knowledge on the set of nodes into the optimization problem. Let's say you want the salesman to visit node 1 after the second trip ($k=2$, it is the third node he visits), then by negatively weighting $x_{2N+1}$ the cost function will (likely) obtain a lower/smaller optimal (minimal) value if it gives this variable the value 1. \n",

    "1. The problem type is a pubo (polynomial unconstrained binary optimization) - the variables ($x_k$) that are optimized for can take a value of 0, or 1.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Because these optimizations don't guarantee to find the optimal solution, you have to verify the solution that is returned by the solver. Also it is smart to run the solver a couple of times to see if it returns the same solution. Additionally, having longer optimization times (larger timeout) can return better solutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The solution the solver returns is heavily influenced by the constraint weights. Feel free to play around with these (called tuning), and discover if whether you can make the optimization more efficient (faster vs accuracy trade-off). A suggestion would be to make the weights dependent on the cost matrix norm (Frobenius,1,2,etc). \n",
