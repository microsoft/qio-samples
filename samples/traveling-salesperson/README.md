# Solving the traveling salesperson problem with optimization solvers and the Azure Quantum service

## Introduction

This sample provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the traveling salesperson problem, from problem definition to formulation of penalty functions and finally solving the problem using the Microsoft QIO solvers with the Azure Quantum service.

By working through this sample, you will learn:

- How to solve the traveling salesperson problem with Azure Quantum
- Model the problem mathematically to design objective and penalty functions
- Coding of the optimization problem using the Azure Quantum Python SDK
- Verifying results returned by the solver
- Tips and references to help you choose solver settings

> Please note this sample is intended to demonstrate how to formulate the cost function for a well-understood problem mathematically and then map it to a binary QUBO/PUBO format. The Traveling Salesperson Problem is not a good example of a problem that scales well in this format, as detailed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06248).

## Prerequisites

1. [Create an Azure Quantum Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/how-to-create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-portal)
2. [Install the `azure-quantum` Python module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/optimization-install-sdk)
3. (If you want to run the Jupyter notebook) [Install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
4. (Optional) [Run the basic ship loading sample](../ship-loading/)

## Running the sample

There are two ways to run the sample (.ipynb and .py):

- [Jupyter Notebook (step-by-step walkthrough)](./traveling-salesperson.ipynb)
- [Python script (barebones annotations)](./traveling-salesperson.py)

A html file of the Jupyter notebook is attached for improved readability:

- [Html script (more readable format than Jupyter Notebook)](./traveling-salesperson.html)

![Example of html readable format](./media/traveling-salesperson-html.png)

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

To run this sample, use the command line to navigate to the `traveling-salesperson` folder and run `jupyter notebook`

Your web browser should automatically open a new window showing something similar to the below:

![Jupyter Notebook landing page](./media/traveling-salesperson.png)

If this doesn't happen, copy the localhost link shown in the terminal window and paste it into your browser's address bar.

Once you see the page above, simply click on the `traveling-salesperson.ipynb` link to open the sample notebook.

### Running the Python script

- Open up the `traveling-salesperson.py` script using your favorite IDE or a text editor.
- Fill in your Azure Quantum workspace details at the beginning of the script.
- Run the script through your IDE or use the command line to navigate to the `traveling-salesperson` folder and then run `python ./traveling-salesperson.py` or `python3 ./traveling-salesperson.py` (depending on how your environment is set up).
