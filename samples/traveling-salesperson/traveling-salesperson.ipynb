    "## Introduction\n",
    "The traveling salesperson problem is a well-known optimization problem in which the aim is to find a (near) optimal route through a network of nodes. As you will see later on, it is not a straightforward problem to solve as the complexity (difficulty) grows exponentially with the number of nodes. Additionally, due to the rugged (non-convex) optimization space, it is difficult or even impossible to find an optimal route (global minimum/optimal solution) through a large network. Common solvers for these rugged problems are based on searches, which you will implement in this tutorial with Azure QIO!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have to calculate an optimal route for the salesperson over $N$ nodes (addresses). Your manager wants you to minimize the traveling cost (time/distance/money/etc.) such that the salesperson is more profitable. There are a number of constraints which have to be satisfied by the salesperson:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The salesperson is required to visit each node. \n",
    "2. The salesperson may visit each node only once!\n",
    "3. The salesperson starts and finishes in the starting node (headquarters). \n",

    "### 2. Defining the location vectors\n",

The reason for this is that otherwise, the solver would consider the left vector and the right vector equal.

    "### Constraint 2: The salesperson must be somewhere, they can't disappear\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the first constraint, the salesperson is penalized for being in multiple nodes at once. But due do the formulation of this constraint it is possible that the solver puts all all $x_k$ in a location vector equal to zero, meaning that the salesperson could be 'nowhere' after some trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By looking at the code and previous sections you can come to the conclusion that the minimal cost is obtained by setting all $x_k$ to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encourage the salesperson to not disappear, it is necessary to reward them for being somewhere. Rewards can be assigned by incorporating negatively weighted terms to the cost function that decrease the cost function value for valid solutions of the optimization problem (remember we are minimizing the cost here, so reducing cost makes it more likely that a solution will be chosen). To demonstrate this point, take the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{f(x)} := \\underset{x_0, x_1, x_2}{min} x_0 + x_1 - x_2.$$ \n",
    "$$ \\text{with } x_0, x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum value for the example is attained for the solution $x_0$ = 0, $x_1$ = 0, $x_2$ = 1, with the optimal function value equal to -1. Here, the negatively weighted third term encourages $x_2$ to take a value 1 rather than 0, unlike $x_0$ and $x_1$. With this idea in mind, you can stop the salesperson from dissapearing! If the salesperson has to visit $N+1$ nodes over a route then $N+1$ of the $x_k$ variables must be assigned the value 1. Written as an equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{N(N+1)-1} x_k = N+1,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $(N(N+1))$ equal to the number of variables used to represent the origin and destination nodes for each trip. You could split the equation for each location vector seperately, but if you keep the constraint linear in $x_k$ the resulting cost function will be the same. To assign a reward to the salesperson for being at a node, the $x_k$ terms are moved to the right side of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0 = (N+1) -\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N(N+1)-1} x_k \\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may be aware, there is no guarantee which particular $x_k$ the solver will assign the value 1 to in this equation. However, in the previous constraint the salesperson is already enforced to be in a maximum of one node before/after each trip. Therefore with the cost function weights properly tuned, it can be assumed that the salesperson will not be in two or more nodes at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the previous constraint penalizes the salesperson for being at more than one node at a once, while this constraint rewards them for being at as many nodes before/after any trip (also being in multiple nodes at once). The weights of the constraints will effectively determine how well they are satisfied, a balance between the two needs to be found such that both are adhered to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating this constraint in the code can be done by assigning a negative term to each $x_k$. The $N+1$ value can be ignored, since it results in a linear shift of the optimization landscape and does not have an effect on solutions of the the minimization problem."

    "For example, if you want the salesperson to start/end at a particular node, you can assign negative weights to the respective $x_k$ term in the first and last location vector. For node 0 that would result in negatively weighting $x_0$ and $x_{N^2}$, for example. This constraint is the most flexible one, and you can also expand it to encourage the salesperson to visit a specific node, or nodes, at pre-determined trip number $k$. Alternatively, you may see this constraint as a way to integrate prior-knowledge on the set of nodes into the optimization problem. Let's say you want the salesperson to visit node 1 after the second trip ($k=2$, it is the third node they visit), then by negatively weighting $x_{2N+1}$ the cost function will (likely) obtain a lower/smaller optimal (minimal) value if it gives this variable the value 1. \n",

    "### Submitting the optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem subject to the necessary constraints have been defined! Now it is time hand the problem over to the Azure QIO solvers and analyze the routes that are returned to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some essential specifications/explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The problem type is a [PUBO (Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/optimization-binary-optimization) - the variables ($x_k$) that are optimized for can take a value of 0, or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We submit the problem to an Azure QIO solver, which one is up to you. Each has benefits/drawbacks, and [selecting the best one requires some experimentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/optimization-which-solver-should-you-use). To read more about the available solvers, please refer to the [Microsoft QIO solver overview page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/provider-microsoft-qio) on the Azure Quantum docs site.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. These optimizers are heuristics, which means they aren't guaranteed to find the optimal solution (or even a valid one, depending on how well you have encoded your cost function). Due to this, it is important to validate the solution returned. It is also recommended to run the solver several times to see if it returns the same solution. Additionally, having longer optimization times (larger timeout) can return better solutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The solution returned by the solver is heavily influenced by the constraint weights. Feel free to play around with these (called tuning), and discover if you can make the optimization more efficient (speed vs solution quality trade-off). A suggestion would be to make the weights dependent on the cost matrix norm (Frobenius,1,2,etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Here the hardware implementation is defaulted to CPU. For further information on available hardware, please refer to the [Microsoft QIO solver overview page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/provider-microsoft-qio) on the Azure Quantum docs site."
