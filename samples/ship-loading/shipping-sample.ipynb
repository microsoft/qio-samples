    "## The Problem\n",
    "Contoso Logistics Inc is a world class freight company operating a fleet of large container ships. When these ships are docked at port Contoso Logistics needs to distribute containers between the two ships as evenly as possible. If they make one ship significantly heavier than the other then it will move slower and consume more fuel - delaying shipments and costing a significant amount of money! To make things harder, the weights of individual containers can vary greatly so it's not easy to divide them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is known as the Number partitioning problem and is NP-complete. It is however relatively straightforward to apply Quantum Inspired Optimization (QIO) to it to generate a good solution. Let's explore how.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does it mean to Optimize?\n",
    "We're using Quantum-Inspired Optimization to solve this problem - but what does that actually mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, optimize means \"to find a solution with minimal cost\" - which is exactly what the Solvers in Azure Quantum do. They take a representation of a difficult problem and apply techniques from physics to find a solution with the least cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that solvers can be applied to very difficult problems where it's infeasible to confirm whether the solution found is the best solution that exists. So keep in mind that there may be better solutions than those returned by the solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solvers in Azure Quantum expect a `Binary Optimization Problem`, which is a problem expressed in the following (simplified) format:\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Problem\n",
    "In the number partitioning problem, we have a set ${W}$ of container weights which we would like to partition into two sets: ${W_a}$ and ${W_b}$ (containers on the ships, ${a}$ and ${b}$). In this section, our goal will be to develop a representation of the problem that we can provide to the QIO solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breaking down the Problem\n",
    "Let's start by coming up with an equation for the weight of a given ship, which is the sum of all the containers on the ship. This is expressed in the below equation, where ${w_i}$ is the weight of container ${i}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Large\\sum_{i} w_{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we'd like a solution where the weight difference between the ships is as small as possible. This is expressed by the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\Large\\sum_{i \\in A} w_i - \\Large\\sum_{i \\in B} w_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of ${H}$ is zero, we know the ships are equally loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll introduce a variable, ${x_i}$, to represent whether an individual container ${i}$ is assigned to ship ${a}$ or ship ${b}$. Because we can assign the container ${i}$ to either ship, the variable ${x_i}$ can be take on two different values - which makes it a `binary` variable. For convenience, we'll say the two values it can take on are ${1}$ and ${-1}$. ${1}$ will represent that the container is placed on ship ${a}$, and ${-1}$ will represent that the container is placed on ship ${b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because of our choice to make ${i}$ be either ${1}$ or ${-1}$ this type of problem is called an `Ising` problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing this variable ${x_i}$ to the previous equation, it can be simplified to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\Large\\sum_{i \\in A \\cup B} w_ix_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ x_i = \\begin{cases} +1 & \\textrm{if   }i \\in A \\\\ -1 & \\textrm{if   }i \\in B \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function ${H}$ will be called our `cost function` as it describes the cost of a given solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The letter ${H}$ is traditionally used to represent a cost function and is also referred to as a `Hamiltonian` in a nod towards the quantum mechanical roots of Quantum-Inspired Optimization techniques."

    "## The final model\n",
    "There's one last change we need to make before we can solve our problem. If we look at our cost function ${H}$ there's a flaw: the solution with the _least_ cost is to simply assign all containers to ship ${b}$ by setting all ${x_i}={-1}$ - that's not right! To fix this we'll take a simple step - we'll square the right hand side of the equation so that it cannot be negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H^{2} = \\Large(\\sum_{i \\in A \\cup B} w_{i} x_{i})^{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is somewhat arbitrary, but it yields a cost function with the right properties:\n",
    "- If all the containers are on one ship, the function is at its highest value - reflecting that this is the least optimal solution\n",
    "- If the containers are perfectly balanced, the value of the summation inside the square is ${0}$ - the function is at its lowest value\n",
    "- In this case, we don't care about the actual value of ${H}$, just that it's as small as possible.\n",
