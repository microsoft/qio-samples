# 1QBit Python SDK Basic Sample
This sample has demonstrates how to target 1QBit solvers with a basic problem [using the Python SDK](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Use-the-Python-SDK-for-Quantum-Inspired-Optimization).

## Prerequisites
To run this sample, please ensure you have [created an Azure Quantum Workspace](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-Azure-portal), and followed the [installation steps for the Python SDK](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Use-the-Python-SDK-for-Quantum-Inspired-Optimization).

## Running the sample
To execute the sample, run:
```bash
python 1qbit.py
```
